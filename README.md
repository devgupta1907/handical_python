## HANDICAL 1.01SF - A Personal Scheduler and Calendar Application
ðŸš€ My first-ever complex Python project from Class XII developed by me in 2020 - HANDICAL 1.01SF, a Personal Scheduler and Calendar Application!


Built entirely in Python, HANDICAL serves as an all-in-one tool for managing personal schedules, viewing calendar details, and keeping track of important events. Dive into what it offers:
- Calendar Viewing Options:
    * Display an entire year or a specific month's calendar.
    * Determine the day of the week for any given date.

- Event Management:
    * Securely create, read, delete, and search for events using a file-based system with pickle for data serialization.

- Date Utilities:
    * Check if a year is a leap year.
    * Calculate the number of leap days between two years.
    * Compute the exact age from a birthdate in years, months, and days.

- User Interaction:
    * Personalized greetings by name and guided options through simple input prompts.
    * Enhanced security with password-protected access to sensitive functionalities.



Technical Highlights ðŸ”§:
- Mastery of Python's datetime and calendar modules for handling complex date computations.
- Utilization of exception handling to ensure robust user input processing.
- Implementation of file operations for persistent data storage and retrieval.
